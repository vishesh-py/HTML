            <p>The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic, one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India (the other being the Ramayana). With approximately 1.8 million words and over 100,000 verses, it is the longest epic poem ever written.</p>
            
            <h3 id="main-story">Main Story</h3>
            <p>The epic narrates the struggle between two groups of cousins - the Kauravas and the Pandavas - in the Kurukshetra War, and the fates of these cousins and their successive generations. The central conflict arises from a dynastic succession struggle between these two groups for the throne of Hastinapura.</p>
